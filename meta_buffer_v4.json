Specifically, for each node \\( r \\):\n\n1. **DFS Traversal**: Perform a DFS starting from the root node. As you traverse, maintain a count of the frequency of edge colors encountered along the path from the root to the current node.\n\n2. **Subtree Analysis**: For each node \\( r \\), collect all descendant nodes (forming the subtree rooted at \\( r \\)) and record the frequency of edge colors leading to each of these nodes.\n\n3. **Permutation Check**: Implement a function to verify if a permutation of nodes in the subtree can be arranged such that for each parent-child pair within the subtree, the frequency of colors respects the permutation condition specified.\n\n4. **Recursive Verification**: As you backtrack in the DFS, calculate and store the \"beautiful\" status for each subtree using memoization to avoid redundant calculations.\n\n5. **Output Result**: After processing, output a binary result for each subtree indicating whether it is \"beautiful\" (1) or not (0).\n\nThis strategy leverages DFS for efficient tree traversal and utilizes frequency counting and memoization to handle permutation checks systematically, ensuring each subtree is processed with respect to the problem constraints.",
